    <h1>ENGRAMS</h1>
    <p>As I said before, Engrams are strange objects that contain weapons and armour.
         They are crystal like objects. their shape seems to be a pentagonal dodecahedron. There are three types of engrams I will discuss.
        The Rare Engram, Legendary Engram, and the Exotic Engram.
         Please keep in mind that these are not the only engrams, and what I say about these engrams are only compared to each other, not any other engrams in the game.
    <h2>RARE ENGRAM</h2>

The Rare Engram is the most common engram I will discuss. It is a blue engram and drops rare gear only.
 They are useful to beginners, but as you progress in the game they become more and more useless.</p>

 <p><h2>LEGENDARY ENGRAM</h2>
