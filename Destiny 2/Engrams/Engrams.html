    <h1>ENGRAMS</h1>
    <p>As I said before, Engrams are strange objects that contain weapons and armour.
         They are crystal like objects. their shape seems to be a pentagonal dodecahedron. There are three types of engrams I will discuss.
        The Rare Engram, Legendary Engram, and the Exotic Engram.
         Please keep in mind that these are not the only engrams, and what I say about these engrams are only compared to each other, not any other engrams in the game.
    <h2>RARE ENGRAM</h2>
<img id="Rare-Engram" src="Images/Rare Engram.jpg" alt="Rare-Engram">
The Rare Engram is the most common engram I will discuss. It is a blue engram and drops rare gear only.
 They are useful to beginners, but as you progress in the game they become more and more useless.
</p>

 <p><h2>LEGENDARY ENGRAM</h2> 
<img id="Legendary-Engram" src="Images/Legendary Engrams.jpg" alt="Legendary-Engram">
The Legendary Engram is an engram that is much more useful than the Rare Engram.
 The Legendary Engram is a purple engram that drops legendary gear.
legendary gear can be dismantled for legendary shards, which are a form of currency.
 This makes the Legendary Engram useful to every player in the game, regardless of their experience.
</p>

<p><h2>EXOTIC ENGRAM</h2>
    <img id="Exotic-Engram" src="Images/Exotic Engram.jpg" alt="Exotic-Engram">
No doubt about it, the Exotic Engram is the best engram in the game, but it is also the most rare. This yellow engram drops only exotic gear, the best gear in the game.
Every exoitc gear has an extra buff added on to it, making them very powerful. This also makes the Exotic Engram the most powerful engram.
There are other ways to get engrams, but usually those are thorugh very long and hard quests, so for many players waiting for one of these engrams to drop is the best thing they can do.
