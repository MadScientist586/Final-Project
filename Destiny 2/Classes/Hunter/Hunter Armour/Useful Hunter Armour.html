    <h1>HELPFUL TITAN ARMOUR</h1>
    <p>Below is a list of very helpful Hunter armour. They are hard to acquire but will help a lot. Please keep in mind that these armours are all exotics and cannot be worn at the same time, for you can only equip one exotic armour at a time.</p>

    <h2>Assassin's Cowl</h2>

    <p>The Assassin's Cowl grants invisibility when you defeat an enemy with a final blow and restores a prtion of health and shields.
         Finishers and final blows against more powerful targets increase the duration of the invisibility and the amount of health and shields restored.</p>
    <h2>Omnioculus</h2>

    <p>With this chestplate equipped you will gain a second Smoke Bomb charge and have damage resistance when invisible.
         When you make an ally invisible, they gain damage resistance and you gain melee energy.</p>
    <h2>Aeon Swift</h2>

    <p>Instead of having an exotic perk, these gauntlets have an ectra mod socket, allowing you to choose from one of three mods.
        <b style="color:aqua">Sect of Force </b>— You specialize in punishing powerful combatants before they can harm your allies.
        <b style="color:aqua">Sect of Insight</b> — You specialize in empowering your allies and keeping them well supplied.
        <b style="color:aqua">Sect of Vigor</b> — You specialize in keeping your allies in the fight.
    </p>
    <h2>Star Eater Scales</h2>
    <img id="Star-Eater-Scales" src="Star-Eater-Scales.jpg" alt="Star-Eater-Scales"></img>
    <p>With these greaves you will gain additional super energy form orbs of power you pick up.
         While your super energy is full, picking up an orb of power will over charge your super, giving you a burst of healing and bonus to super damage when you cast it.
         you will gain an overshield at max overcharge.</p>
