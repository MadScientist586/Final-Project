    <h1>HUNTER</h1>
    <p>The Hunter class is a very popular class becuase the Hunter is the stealthy class. With this class you have access to a large number of special knives that you can use to kill an enemy after sneaking up on them.
         Some Hunters even have a tendancy to disappear. The Hunter subclass is used by people who like being the balanced character.
         They have a considerable amount of damage, but they also have a considerable amount of protection, due to their stealth.
        Like the other classes, you can choose one of three subclasses, <a style="color:aqua" href="Subclasses/Arc.html">Arc</a>, <a style="color:aqua" href="Subclasses/Solar.html">Solar</a>, and <a style="color:aqua" href="Subclasses/Void.html">Void</a>.
    As I said before, there are many different armours due to the fact that one piece of armour cannot be used for multiple classes, only the class it says it is for. For example, if you have a Hunter chestplate, only your Hunter character will be able to equip it. 
    thankfully it is not this way with the weapons. There are four pieces of armour, helmet, chestplate, gauntlets, and greaves. To see a list of helpful Hunter armours, <a style="color:aqua" href="Hunter Armour/Useful Hunter Armour.html">click here</a>.
    The Hunter's normal melee is a knife to stab with. The Hunter does not have a form of protection, but in place of it they can dodge/roll and turn invisible. There are two dodges to choose from in every subclass. Marksman's Dodge — Dodge to perform an evasive maneuver with a steady hand. Dodging automatically reloads your weapon.
    Gambler's Dodge — Dodge to perform a deft tumble, avoiding enemy attack. Dodging near enemies fully recharges your melee ability. There are many different special melees for each subclass so I will explain each one in the Hunter subclasses. </p>
