    <h1>HUNTER ARC</h1>
    <p>The Arc subclass is considered the worst subclass for Hunters, but it is the easiest to use. A Hunter that uses Arc is called an Arcstrider.
         This subclass is all about speed, agression, and using your body for a weapon. There is one super to choose from. 
         <b>Arc Staff</b> — Form a staff of pure Arc energy and acrobatically take out your foes.
         There are three melee abilities to choose from. <b>Combination Blow</b> — Kill an enemy with this melee ability to trigger health regeneration and increase your melee damage temporarily.
         <b>Tempest Strike</b> — After sliding, activate this melee ability to unleash a devastating uppercut attack. 
         <b>Disorienting Blow</b> — Strike an enemy with this melee ability to disorient the target and nearby enemies.
        There are also three basic grenades to choose from. <b>Skip Grenade</b> — A grenade that splits upon impact, creating multiple projectiles that seek enemies.
        <b>Flux Grenade</b> — An explosive grenade that deals additional damage when attached to enemies.
       <b> Arcbolt Grenade</b> — A grenade that chains bolts of lightning to nearby enemies. Visit Ikora Rey in the Tower to unlock more grenades.
