    <h1>HELPFUL WARLOCK ARMOUR</h1>
    <p>Below is a list of very helpful Warlock armour. They are hard to acquire but will help a lot. Please keep in mind that these armours are all exotics and cannot be worn at the same time, for you can only equip one exotic armour at a time.</p>

    <h2>THE STAG</h2>

    <p>The Stag's specialty is Rifts. When equipped, Rifts will grant additional damage resistance to the player and any allies standing in their Rift.
        This also affects the Well of Radiance. Players will also receive extra Rift energy when they are in critical health, which can be useful in certain PVP modes, too.
        Probably the most useful part of this is that upon death, players with the helmet will spawn a Rift on their body when they die.</p>
    <h2>MANTLE OF BATTLE HARMONY</h2>
    <img id="Mantle-of-Battle-Harmony" src="Mantle-of-Battle-Harmony.jpeg" alt="Mantle-of-Battle-Harmony"></img>
    <p> The Mantle of Battle Harmony is a very useful chestpiece. When you kill an enemy with a weapon that has a damage type matching your subclass, you will get extra super energy.
         While your super energy is full, you gain a temporary damage bonus to weapons that have the same damage type of your subclass.</p>
    <h2>KARNSTEIN ARMLETS</h2>
    <img id="Karnstein-Armlets" src="Karnstein-Armlets Warlock.jpg" alt="Karnstein-Armlets"></img>
    The Karnstein Armlets are powered by melee kills, which grant the player a burst of health and temporarily grants health regeneration.
     These armlets make PVP very easy for people who like going close range, especially with a shotgun.
      This also makes for a good defensive ability if you are being swarmed in PVE.
    <h2>BOOTS OF THE ASSEMBLER</h2>
    <img id="Boots-of-the-Assembler" src="Boots-of-the-Assembler.jpg" alt="Boots-of-the-Assembler"></img>
    The Boots of the Assembler is most likely the best Warlock armor ever. Standing in a healing rift creates Noble Seekers that follows your allies that are not in a rift and heal them.
     Standing in an empowering rift creates Noble Seekers that grant both you and your ally a damage bonus.
     Each time a Noble Seeker finds one of your allies, the duration of your rift is briefly extended while you are standing in it.
      These leggings very good for PVP becuase you and your allies will no longer have to stand in a small little circle to get buffs.
       While everyone is in combat just throw down your rift and you all will have the buffs, no matter how seperated you are from your teamates.
