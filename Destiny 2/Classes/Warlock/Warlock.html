    <h3>This is a picture of a very experienced player, please keep in mind your character will not start like this.</h3>

    <h1>Warlock</h1>
    <h2>SUBCLASSES</h2>
    <p>The Warlock class is a less popular class becuase the Warlock is more of a support class.
         Nevertheless, you can turn the Warlock into a very powerful character if you choose the right build.
          The Warlock subclass is used by people who like being the support character, helping their teamates along the way, and at the same time doing a considerable amount of damage to enemies.
           They are crucial for a team that is going to take on a tough boss or raid. 
        Like the other classes, you can choose one of three subclasses, <a style="color:aqua" href="Subclasses/Arc.html">Arc</a>, <a style="color:aqua" href="Subclasses/Solar.html">Solar</a>, and <a style="color:aqua" href="Subclasses/Void.html">Void</a>.</p>
        <h2>ARMOUR</h2>
    <p>As I said before, there are many different armours due to the fact that one piece of armour cannot be used for multiple classes, only the class it says it is for.
     For example, if you have a Warlock chestplate, only your Warlock character will be able to equip it. 
    thankfully it is not this way with the weapons. There are four pieces of armour, helmet, chestplate, gauntlets, and greaves.
     To see a list of helpful Warlock armours, <a style="color:aqua" href="Warlock Armour/Useful Warlock Armour.html">click here</a>.</p>

    <p>The Warlock's normal melee is a small wave of magic that comes out of the character's hand.</p> 
    <p>The Warlock's form of protection is a rift that they spawn on the ground. You can choose one of two rifts.</p>
    <img style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px;" src="Images/Healing-Rift.jpg" width="25"/>
     <p><b style="color:aqua">Healing Rift</b> - heals anyone standing inside it, unless they are on the opposite team in PVP or an enemy in PVE.</p>
     <img style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px;" src="Images/Empowering-Rift.jpg" width="25"/>
    <p><b style="color:aqua">Empowering Rift</b> - grants buffs to the weapons and extra damage to anyone standing inside, unless, once again, they are on the opposite team in PVP or an enemy in PVE.</p>
     <p>There are many different special melees for each subclass so I will explain each one in the Warlock subclasses. </p>
