    <h1>WARLOCK VOID</h1>
    <p>Void is considered the best subclass for Warlocks. A Warlock that uses Void is called a Voidwalker. There is only one super you can choose, but it pack a punch. Nova Bomb — Hurl an explosive bolt of Void Light at the enemy, disintegrating those caught within its blast. There are three basic grenades to choose from.
        Vortex Grenade — A grenade that creates a Vortex which continually damages enemies trapped inside.
 Axion Bolt — A bolt of Void Light that forks into smaller bolts on impact that seek out enemies.
 Scatter Grenade — A grenade that splits into many submunitions and covers a large area with multiple explosions. You can visit Ikora Rey at the tower to unlock more grenades.</p>
