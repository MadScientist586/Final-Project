    <h1>WARLOCK VOID</h1>
    <p>Void is considered the best subclass for Warlocks. A Warlock that uses Void is called a Voidwalker.
         There is only one super you can choose, but it pack a punch.
          <b>Nova Bomb</b> — Hurl an explosive bolt of Void Light at the enemy, disintegrating those caught within its blast.
          There are three melee abilities to choose from.
          <b>Entropic Pull</b> — Strike an enemy with this melee ability to drain your enemy's life force and use it to recharge your grenade.
          <b>Atomic Breach</b> — This melee ability creates a Void explosion.
          <b>Devour</b> — Kills with this melee ability fully regenerate your health. For a short time afterward, kills restore additional health.
         There are also three basic grenades to choose from.
        <b>Vortex Grenade</b> — A grenade that creates a Vortex which continually damages enemies trapped inside.
 <b>Axion Bolt</b> — A bolt of Void Light that forks into smaller bolts on impact that seek out enemies.
 <b>Scatter Grenade</b> — A grenade that splits into many submunitions and covers a large area with multiple explosions. You can visit Ikora Rey at the tower to unlock more grenades.</p>
