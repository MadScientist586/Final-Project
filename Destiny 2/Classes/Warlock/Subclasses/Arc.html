    <h1>WARLOCK ARC</h1>

    <p>Arc is a powerful subclass for warlocks, but Solar and Void are considered better. A Warlock that uses Arc is called a Stormcaller. There is only one super you can choose, but with it you will really shock your enemies.
        Stormtrance — Chain Arc Lightning from your hands and electrify enemies with devastating streams of Arc Light that intensify over time.
        This is a powerful super because over time the streams of Arc Light intensify and deal even more damage. There are three basic grenades to choose from in this subclass.
        Arcbolt Grenade — A grenade that chains bolts of lightning to nearby enemies.
Pulse Grenade — A grenade that periodically damages enemies inside its explosion radius.
Storm Grenade — A grenade that calls down a focused lightning storm. You can visit Ikora Rey at the tower to unlock more grenades.</p>
