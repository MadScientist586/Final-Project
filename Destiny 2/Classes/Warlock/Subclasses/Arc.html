    <h1>WARLOCK ARC</h1>

    <p>Arc is a powerful subclass for warlocks, but Solar and Void are considered better. A Warlock that uses Arc is called a Stormcaller. There is only one super you can choose, but with it you will really shock your enemies.
        <b>Stormtrance</b> — Chain Arc Lightning from your hands and electrify enemies with devastating streams of Arc Light that intensify over time.
        This is a powerful super because over time the streams of Arc Light intensify and deal even more damage.
        There are two melee abilities to choose from. <b>Chain Lightning</b> — This electrocuting melee ability chains lightning from the struck target to nearby enemies.
       <b>Rising Storm</b> — This electrocuting melee ability recharges your Super, grenade, and melee energy.
        There are also three basic grenades to choose from in this subclass.
        <b>Arcbolt Grenade</b> — A grenade that chains bolts of lightning to nearby enemies.
<b>Pulse Grenade</b> — A grenade that periodically damages enemies inside its explosion radius.
<b>Storm Grenade</b> — A grenade that calls down a focused lightning storm. You can visit Ikora Rey at the tower to unlock more grenades.</p>
