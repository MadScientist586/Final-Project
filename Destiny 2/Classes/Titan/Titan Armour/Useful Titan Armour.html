    <h1>HELPFUL TITAN ARMOUR</h1>
    <p>Below is a list of very helpful Titan armour. They are hard to acquire but will help a lot. Please keep in mind that these armours are all exotics and cannot be worn at the same time, for you can only equip one exotic armour at a time.</p>

    <h2>One-Eyed Mask</h2>

    <p>The One-Eyed Mask gives players the ability to see enemies that have damaged them, no matter where the enemy is. This gives them the chance to track who shot at them and make them pay. If you kill the enemy who shot you you will gain an overshield. This helmet is mainly used for PVP.</p>
    <h2>Heart of Inmost Light</h2>
    <img id="Heart-of-Inmost-Light" src="Heart Of Inmost Light Titan.jpg" alt="Heart-of-Inmost-Light"></img>
    <p>When players use a grenade, melee, or barricade with this chestplate equipped, the other two remaining abilities are strengthened.
        The abilities will regenerate faster, and deal more damage. This is very useful for PVP becuase when all your cooldowns are regenerating, unless you have a powerful weapon or are very skilled, you basically have no defenses.</p>
    <h2>Citan's Ramparts</h2>
    <img id="Citans-Ramparts" src="Citan's Ramparts Titan.jpg" alt="Citans-Ramparts"></img>
    <p>Citan's Ramparts are one of the most useful items in the game. These gloves allow the player and other guardians to shoot through the Towering Barricade that the player puts up without doing damage to the shield. Although the shield has less health and duration, this makes for amazing protection.
         If you are using this in PVP only guardians on your team will be able to shoot through the barricade.</p>
    <h2>Peregrine Greaves</h2>
    <img id="Peregrine-Greaves" src="Peregrine Greaves.jpg" alt="Peregrine-Greaves"></img>
    <p>The Peregrine Greaves gives the player immense power, but only if the player is using a Titan Bash. If a player is using this leg piece and activates their Titan Bash in the air, the bash will have increase damage and power.
         This is a favorite armour in PVP becuase if you are on the high ground and see someone jumping up to you, you can use this to bash them back down to ensure they won't get back up.</p>
