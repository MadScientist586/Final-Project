    <h1>TITAN VOID</h1>
    <p>Void is considered the best subclass for Titans. A Titan that uses Void is called a Sentinel. There are one of two supers to choose from. Sentinel Shield — Form a Void shield that can bash enemies in melee range and be thrown from a distance as a projectile. Ward of Dawn — When Super energy is full, press and hold to create a shielding dome to protect you and your allies.
         There are three grenades to choose from. Magnetic Grenade—An explosive grenade that attaches to enemies and detonates twice.
         Voidwall Grenade—A grenade that creates a horizontal wall of burning Void energy.
         Suppressor Grenade—An explosive grenade that temporarily suppresses enemy abilities. Visit Ikora Rey in the tower to unlock more grenades.</p>
