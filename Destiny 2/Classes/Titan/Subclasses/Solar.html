    <h1>Solar</h1>
    <P>Solar is considered one tof the most powerful subclasses along with void. A Titan that uses Solar is called a Sunbreaker. There are one of two supers to choose from. Hammer of Sol: Summon a flaming hammer and wreak destruction down upon your enemies. Throw your hammer at foes. Upon impact, your hammer shatters into explosive molten shards.
        Burning Maul: Summon a flaming maul and crush your enemies with the force of an earthquake. Spin the Maul in a circle around you, damaging nearby targets. Slam the maul to the ground and create a cyclone of flames that seeks targets. Like the other subclasses there are three basic grenades to choose from. Incendiary Grenade — A grenade that sets enemies on fire when it explodes. 
        Thermite Grenade — A grenade that sends forward a burning line of fire. Fusion Grenade — An explosive grenade that attaches to enemies. Visit Ikora Rey in the Tower to unlock more grenades.</P>
