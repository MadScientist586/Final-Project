    <h1>TITAN</h1>
    <p>The Titan class is a very popular class due to the fact that titans are the damage class. The Titan subclass is used by people who like rushing into battle, taking on a lot of enemies, and dealing lots of damage. They are crucial for a team that is going to take on a tough boss or raid. 
        Like the other subclasses, you can choose one of three subclasses, <a style="color:aqua" href="Subclasses/Arc.html">Arc</a>, <a style="color:aqua" href="Subclasses/Solar.html">Solar</a>, and <a style="color:aqua" href="Subclasses/Void.html">Void</a>.
    As I said before, there are many different armours due to the fact that one piece of armour cannot be used for multiple classes, only the class it says it is for. For example, if you have a Titan chestplate, only your Titan character will be able to equip it. 
    thankfully it is not this way with the weapons. There are four pieces of armour, <a style="color:aqua" href="Titan Armour/Helmet.html">helmet</a>, <a style="color:aqua" href="Titan Armour/Chestplate.html">chestplate</a>, <a style="color:aqua" href="Titan Armour/Gloves.html">gauntlets</a>, and <a style="color:aqua" href="Titan Armour/Greaves.html">greaves</a>. 
    The Titan's form of protection is a shield. You can choose one of two shields. The towering barricade provides full shelter from oncoming enemy fire form the front, but you cannot shoot through the shield becuase your shots deal damage to the barricade. 
    The rally barricade is shorter than the towering barricade and will only protect you if you are crouching, but there is a space in the middle to shoot at your enemies from. You can also choose one of two melee abilities. The first and probably most popular is the Titan Bash. 
    With this melee your character dashes forward and slams the enemy with its solar hammer/ void shield/ fist, dealing lots of damage. 
    If you do not hit an enemy the cooldown will not be depleted, making this ability a very good way to move around fast. 
    The only downsides are that you have to be close enough to hit your enemy, and it only works if you are dashing. 
    The second is the throw ability. With this ability your titan throws a solar hammer/ void shield and deals a lot of damage if it hits the enemy. If it doesn't, however, the cooldown depletes itself. 
    But if, and ONLY IF you are using Solar, you can touch the hammer you threw and the cooldown will go back to the top. There is no throw ability for Arc. In place of it there is a charge up ability called Ballistic Slam. After sprinting, leap into the air and press the melee button to slam into the ground and damage nearby targets. </p>
