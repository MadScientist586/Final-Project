    <h1>WEAPONS</h1>
    <p>Below is a list of very helpful weapons. They are hard to acquire but will help a lot.
         Please keep in mind that these weapons are all exotics and cannot be equipped at the same time, for you can only equip one exotic weapon at a time.</p>
         <h2>RISKRUNNER</h2>
         <h3>Weapon type: Submachine Gun</h3>
         <h4>Weapon slot: Secondary Weapon</h4>
         <h4>Weapon ammo type: Primary Ammo</h4>
         <img id="Riskrunner" src="Images/Riskrunner.jpg" alt="Riskrunner">
         <p>This gun may look like an ordinary submachine gun, but it is actually very shocking what this gun can do.
             When you take Arc Damage this secondary weapon becomes more powerful and resists any other Arc Damage you get hit by.
              Kills extend the time of the overcharge.
               When the weapon is overcharged the shots fired have the change to become chain lightning and return ammo.</p>
               <h2>PARASITE</h2>
               <h3>Weapon type: Grenade Launcher</h3>
               <h4>Weapon slot: POWER Weapon</h4>
               <h4>Weapon ammo type: Heavy Ammo</h4>
               <img id="Parasite" src="Images/Parasite.jpg" alt="Parasite">
               <p>This strange looking grenade launcher is a very rare weapon becuase you can only obtain it one way: by completing The Witch Queen expansion pack.
                It was made by Mara Sov, the Queen of the Awoken, who turned a trecherous worm into this weapon so it could no longer trick people, hence the name.
                This weapon fires Hive worms that exploade on impact. THe size/damage of the explosion depends on how many enemies you have defeated before firing the weapon.
                Taking damage from your own worm grenade will empower your weapons for a short time.
               </p>

               <h2>OSTEO STRIGA</h2>
               <h3>Weapon type: Submachine Gun</h3>
               <h4>Weapon slot: Primary Weapon</h4>
               <h4>Weapon ammo type: Primary Ammo</h4>
               <img id="Osteo-Striga" src="Images/Osteo Striga.jpg" alt="Osteo-Striga">
               <p>This sharp looking submachine gun is certainly one of the best Witch Qeen exotics. This is also a rare weapon because, like the Parasite, you must complete the Witch Queen story to obtain it.
                But you dont just get it directly. you get the pattern for it, which means that you have to go to The Relic in The Enclave on Mars and craft it. This is very useful, however, becuase you can choose what you want for the small perk.
                You can also re-craft it and choose other perks. Its only unchangeable perk is its exotic perk, which is very useful. Instead of firing bullets, this gun fires bug-like projectiles that follow the enemy and deals poison damage.
                When the enemy dies it will create a poison explosion, which will deal more poison damage to other enemies nearby.
               </p>

               <h2>JOTUNN</h2>
               <h3>Weapon type: Fusion Rifle</h3>
               <h4>Weapon slot: Secondary Weapon</h4>
               <h4>Weapon ammo type: Special Ammo</h4>
               <img id="Jotunn" src="Images/Jotunn.jpg" alt="Jotunn">
               <p>This weapon may look like an oversized toaster, but the only thing you will be toasing is your enemies.
                The shots from this weapon are extremely explosive, and will kill any player in PVP in one shot.
                 The blast radius is enormous and it seems impossible to survive.
                  On top of that the shots will also track your enemies, making this one of the most pwoerful fusion rifles in the game.
                   This weapon is only obtainable through the Forsaken pack.
               </p>

               <h2>HUCKLEBERRY</h2>
               <h3>Weapon type: Submachine Gun</h3>
               <h4>Weapon slot: Primary Weapon</h4>
               <h4>Weapon ammo type: Primary Ammo</h4>
               <img id="Huckleberry" src="Images/Huckleberry.jpg" alt="Huckleberry">
               <p>This beast of a weapon will shred through your enemies like they are a flimsy sheet of paper.
                THis weapon grants increases the rate of fire while holding down the trigger.
                 Kills will reload a portion of the magazine and grand increased damage.
                 This makes this weapon extremely overpowered for both PVP and PVE.
               </p>
               <h2>BAD JUJU</h2>
               <h3>Weapon type: Pulse Rifle</h3>
               <h4>Weapon slot: Primary Weapon</h4>
               <h4>Weapon ammo type: Primary Ammo</h4>
               <img id="Bad-Juju" src="Images/Bad Juju.jpg" alt="Bad-Juju">
               <p>This pulse rifle is very underrated.
                 Many people who acquire this weapon think that it should just be a normal pulse rifle, but they don't test it enough.
                 This weapon is actually an enemy shredder. It fires full-auto and has amasing range.
                  Kills with this weapon refill the magazine, increase damage for a short time, and grant super energy.
                  This makes a very good weapon for long-range PVP maps.
                   This is especially good for PVE becuase when you kill a large amunt of enemies it make your super energy recharge much faster.
                   Sadly, this weapon is only obtainable through the Forsaken pack.
                </p>

                <h2>Ace of Spades</h2>
               <h3>Weapon type: Hand Cannon</h3>
               <h4>Weapon slot: Primary Weapon</h4>
               <h4>Weapon ammo type: Primary Ammo</h4>
               <img id="Ace-of-Spades" src="Images/Ace Of Spades.jpg" alt="Ace-of-Spades">
               <p>The Ace of Spades is probably one of the most nostalgic and saddening weapons in the game.
                 In the Forsaken campaign, you and a beloved Hunter Exo called Cayde-6 was killed forever after his ghost died.
                This saddened many players. Destiny 2 gifted this weapon to everyone with the Forsaken pack as a memorial to Cayde-6.
            Although this weapon has a very saddening story behind it, it is still undoubtedly one of the best hand cannons in the game.
        When you reload after a kill this gun loads the magazine with a few extra-damage bullets. It also grants a radar when aiming down sights.
        Precision kills with this weapon (e.g. headshots) increases reload speed and causses the targent to expload, dealing Solar damage to nearby enemies.
