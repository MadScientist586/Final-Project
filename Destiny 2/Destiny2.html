    <p> Destiny 2 is a RPG game set in the future, where your task is to protect humanity, which is on the brink of collapsing.
        You can choose one of three species to play as, Human, Exo (robot), or Awoken, which is a type of alien. After you choose your species you can customize your character's visual traits, eye color, hair style, hair color, etc. You can also choose one out of three classes to play as,
        <a style="color:aqua" href="Classes/Titan/Titan.html">Titan,</a>
        <a style="color:aqua" href="Classes/Hunter/Hunter.html">Hunter,</a>
        and
        <a style="color:aqua" href="Classes/Warlock/Warlock.html">Warlock.</a> Once you choose your class you can then choose your subclass, or power. Since the details of these powers vary in each class, I have not written them down here. To see them, click the link to whichever class you want to view, and there will be a description about them in each one.</p>

        <p>Once you choose your class the game starts, you first see a floating ball-like robot called a Ghost, and it seems that he generates you out of thin air. he then informs you about what had happen to you. He says that you had been killed and he had just revived you. He also informs you that you are in the Cosmodrome in Russia, and that most of Earth has been over thrown and was abandoned by humanity. He then takes you towards where you need to go to be transported back to civilization. there are some enemies along the way, but you start with a gun and collect more later on. at the end of this tutorial there is a giant tank that you have to defeat. Usually there are a few other player attacking it as well, so that will make it easier. You are soon taken to the tower, where you will be informed on what to do.</p>

        <h1 style="size: x-large"> WEAPONS AND ARMOUR</h1>

        <p>Weapons and armor are obviously very crucial in this game. You start out with a beginner gun and armour, but this is not enough to bring you through the whole game. As you venture through the different planets you will stumble upon objects called <a style="color:aqua" href="Engrams/Engrams.html">engrams</a>. 
            When you touch an engram a piece of gear will appear in your inventory, whether it be weapons or armour. Each piece of gear has a certain power level. The higher power level tof the gear you have equipped, the more overall power you have. Your power level is important because in order to do certain events and raids and deal damage to certain enemies you need a higher power level, but also keep in mind that different gear has different stats, and depending on what you like, a lower power weapon/armour might be better for you.
             In this case you can do one of two things, you could keep the lower power gear and dismantle the higher power one for parts and currency, or you could use an upgrade module, which can be found by dismantling items that have been infuse by another item or bought from Banshee-44 in the Tower.
              Upgrade modules have the capability of infusing the power level from a higher level item to a lower level item. Guns can be used by any class. Armour, however is class-specific, meaning that only certain armours can go with certain classes. Click one of the Titan, Warlock, or Hunter links above to find out more.
